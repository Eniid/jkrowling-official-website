# How to contribute translations

There are roughly 3,000 words from each the Italian and German translations that are missing from our archives. With fan translations we can fill in those gaps.

To contribute you have two options:

1. Just translate and let someone else input the text back into the proper places.

 Check out the files in [these folders](). They contain all the currently untranslated text for each language.
 
 Follow the notes in the files and translate them.

2. Translate the actual files themselves.

 As in the previous method, you can see the text that needs to be translated in [these folders]().
 
 To save the text edit the following files. Just edit the text, do not edit any of the php or xml logic.
