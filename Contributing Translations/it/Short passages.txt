1. Fan site award description (Note: "Fan Sites" is elsewhere translated as "Siti dei fan")
-----------
It is truly humbling to see how many fans have taken the time and trouble to create fan sites dedicated to Harry Potter.  This is why I have created the Fan Site Award, a trophy given for outstanding devotion to, and knowledge about, Harry Potter, not to mention the ingenuity and creativity that make a really memorable site.

2. Leaky Cauldron fansite award
-----------
One of the very best Potter fansites, my PA, Fiddy, often checks stories on the Leaky Cauldron!  And I’ve now met Melissa Anelli, the managing editor, who turned up outside the Albert Hall at my reading of the Order of the Phoenix. I note from the website that she ‘consumes more coffee than is healthy for anyone.’ No wonder I felt an instant connection – books 2 – 4 were entirely fuelled by caffeine (during 1 and 5 I was pregnant and had to cut back).
