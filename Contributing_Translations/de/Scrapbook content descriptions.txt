First typed manuscript of Philosopher's Stone

First typed manuscript of Philosopher's Stone - did it on a manual typewriter and consequently had to re-type the entire chapter every time I changed a paragraph.  Then I had to re-type the whole thing anyway, because it wasn't double spaced.

More idle jottings (Page 1)

More idle jottings.... An attempt (circa Prisoner of Azkaban) early to finalise the names and genders of the teachers at Hogwarts. Also playing around with some names for hippogriffs – still a long way from Buckbeak.

Ancient drawings (Page 4)

This very old drawing comes from "The Midnight Duel" chapter of "Philosopher's Stone".  As you can see, Dean originally joined Harry, Ron, Hermione and Neville for the adventure.  As you can see from the written caption, Dean was called "Gary" in those days.

Page of doodlings (Page 2)

This is a page of doodlings from which the Sorting Hat emerged.  In the top part of the page are all the possible ways of 'sorting' people I considered... a panel of ghosts or prefects, a magical gateway through which each person would have to pass and so on.  I also thought of drawing names out of a hat, which became the sorting hat, and at the bottom right corner you see my first drawing of the Sorting Hat, with the first four lines of its first ever song.

Very early page of Philosopher's Stone

Very early page of Philosopher's Stone written around 1991 and showing plot-line that was abandoned. Would have changed everything!

Ancient drawings (Page 2)

I like this ancient tea-stained picture of Peeves, which was drawn shortly after I introduced him as a character. It is exactly how I visualise him.

Ancient drawings (Page 1)

This is a very old picture of some pages from ‘Dragon Breeding for Pleasure and Profit’ that I drew while I was living in Portugal. You will notice that I have mis-spelled ‘developed’ (too busy concentrating on the lettering) and that I have also mixed up the Hebrides with Orkney (geography has always been one of my weaknesses).

Ancient drawings (Page 3)

I wasn't very well when I drew this picture of Nearly Headless Nick; in fact, I had been ordered to stay in bed, so I was deeply bored. His hair is not very Elizabethan, but I was without a reference work on historical hairstyles to guide me. 

The tea-stains and crease-marks are testimony to the fact that this picture travelled from Portugal to Scotland with me and has undergone eight house moves – and also to the fact that I tend not to file things very well and I knock over a lot of drinks.
