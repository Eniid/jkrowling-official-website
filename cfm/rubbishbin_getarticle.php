Quidditch has even been described as ‘soccer-like’ on several occasions, which is nonsensical to anybody familiar with the rules of both games.  (I am sure this misunderstanding sprang originally from the fact that Ron says to Harry in ‘Philosopher’s Stone’ ‘it’s like football in the Muggle world’, but Ron is referring only to the sport’s immense popularity, not to the game itself.)I did not base Quidditch on any game that exists, or existed, in reality.  Finding the ‘real’ counterpart of things that appear in the Harry Potter books has become a popular newspaper space-filler.  The funny thing is that occasionally people miss what I have thought are glaringly obvious references to things and people in the real world.  Ah well.]]></c><c n="s"><![CDATA[mouldy]]></c></r>

I thought of listing all the many characters in the Harry Potter books who are on the plumper side, to demonstrate what a very diverse group of personalities they are, how they include several of my most important, admirable and lovable characters, and how 'overweight' in no way equates to 'bad' in my fictional world... but Andy from Mugglenet has done it for me.

Yes, the secrets behind my new (ahem) health and beauty regime have been confided to a British newspaper by a 'friend'.  Now, most people stop having imaginary friends once they're adults, but mine sometimes drop in on journalists to give them completely unrecognisable accounts of my life.  My carbon-based friends, however, if asked whether I jog, do pilates and yoga, have a frozen forehead or refuse cake, might well suffer some kind of mirth-induced internal injury.  It would be churlish not to thank the journalist concerned for saying that I look better now than I did in the early days of Harry Potter's success, and I am indeed grateful for the underlying compliment.  In the interests of accuracy, however, I must point out that, far from losing weight, I've gained a good bit since the 'before' photographs featured in the article.  So J K Rowling's top tip for today is: eat more.  Perhaps my next project could be a revolutionary diet book?]]></c><c n="s"><![CDATA[puregarbage]]></c></r>

Here are the facts.The defendants were not religious charities, and theirs was not a religious celebration.  On the contrary, it was a large-scale, commercial, sponsored event involving corporations that included a major Indian high street bank.  The event was, however, set up while a Hindu festival was going on.It was Warner Bros who brought the case, because the rights that were being infringed belong to them, not me.  My name has to be attached to such proceedings as a legal technicality, because I am the underlying creator of Harry Potter series.Also due to a technicality, Warner Bros were obliged to claim damages as part of their claim.  However, they waived this right, and neither sought nor obtained any financial compensation.  It is completely false to assert that they, or I, were trying to take money from anybody, let alone two million rupees.The court ruled that Warner Bros. rights had indeed been infringed, and that events such as the one in question would need Warner Bros.' permission in the future.  The court also restrained all the defendants from any future events infringing Warner Bros. rights.  Some of the news agencies and newspapers who misreported this story subsequently issued corrections and apologies, but the original, false story is still doing the rounds.  In the immortal words of Mark Twain, 'a lie can get halfway around the world before the truth can even get its boots on.'  ]]></c><c n="s"><![CDATA[excessiveadditives,toxic]]></c></r>

For obvious reasons I am not going to identify the person in question - however irritating he was, he does not deserve that - but I can state categorically that I never married him.

It’s quite true that we have been doing building work on our house in Edinburgh, but as we are not setting up a hotel we went for a slightly more moderate number of sleeping quarters - divide fifteen by three and you might find yourself a little closer to the truth.  Actually, it now occurs to me that ‘divide-by-three’ is a good rule to apply to a lot of ‘news’ stories.]]></c><c n="s"><![CDATA[startingtosmell]]></c></r>
