<h2>Section: Rumours</h2>



<h3>Harry is a Metamorphmagus</h3>
<p>A Metamorphmagus is a wizard who has the innate ability to transform their appearance completely, for instance, from black to white, young to old, handsome to plain and so on.  In Harry's extreme youth, he produced some impressive bits of uncontrolled magic when under stress, including making his own hair re-grow overnight after a particularly brutal haircut from Aunt Petunia (a dream that had its roots in my own childhood.  My mother, God bless her, had the idea that she was much more skilled with the kitchen scissors than she really was, and I had a couple of shockingly dreadful 'trims' at her hands.  How I wished that I could simply stick it all back on…)<br><br>Anyway: before they have received training, very young witches and wizards are prone to unstable surges of power, often accidentally producing effects that they may have to train for a few years to be able to reproduce deliberately.  Their magical ability is bottled up for weeks at a time and then, when made angry or frightened, it simply explodes out of them, sometimes (as in the case of the vanishing glass in the chapter of the same name, 'Philosopher's Stone) causing at least as much inconvenience to themselves as others.<br><br>So Harry is not a Metamorphmagus – just a boy who was clearly magical from birth.  <br></p>
