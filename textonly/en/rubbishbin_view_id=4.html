<h3>Harry Potter based on JKR's cousin</h3>
<p>Once more I put fingers to keyboard to state wearily that Harry is a completely imaginary character.  He is not based on any of the men I have met during my lifetime who wore glasses, or any of the boys who had a scar somewhere on their face, or any of my friends who went to boarding school.<br><br>But wait - now I stop and think about it, I'M the real Harry Potter!  I wear glasses, I've got a scar, my school had houses, I sometimes got into troubleâ€¦ so stand by to read a story in some tabloid tomorrow headlined:  'Rowling Demands Half-Share of Own Royalties'.<br><br>Unfortunately and depressingly, these sorts of stories crop up all the time (see my 'Biography').  There is nothing any author can do to stop people claiming that they 'inspired' characters.  I can only tell the truth and trust that readers with a grain of sense will know whom to believe.<br></p>
