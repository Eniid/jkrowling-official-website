<h3>Missing Madeleine</h3>
<p>Jerry and Kate McCann released this last photograph of their daughter before her abduction in the Algarve eight weeks ago. The picture is of Madeleine sitting by the swimming pool on the day she was snatched from her bed. Kate took the photo of Madeleine at 2.29pm on May 3 - Mrs McCann's camera clock is one hour out so the display reads 1.29pm. Less than eight hours later, before 10pm that night, Madeleine disappeared. Mr and Mrs McCann, backed by an army of friends and family, remain convinced that four year old Madeleine is alive and are praying, along with people around the world, for her safe return.<br><br>How you can help<br>If you have any information you can call:<br><br>Portuguese Police direct on 00351 282 405 400<br>Or British Police on 0800 096 1233<br><br>You can also give information anonymously to Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
