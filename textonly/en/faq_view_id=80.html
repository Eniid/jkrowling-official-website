<h2>Section: F.A.Q.</h2>
 


<h3>How can we avoid the middlemen when trying to publish a book?</h3>
<p>I'm really not sure what you mean by 'middlemen'.  Most authors have agents whose job it is to negotiate contracts for them (authors not necessarily being very good businesspeople) and while you do not have to have an agent, I would advise any novice to get one if they can.  Other than your agent, you deal with an editor and perhaps the people marketing your book.  None of these people can be described as 'middlemen', they are simply part of the process of being published.  Of course, if you would rather nobody else is involved, you can self-publish, but that has always sounded like an awful lot of hard work to me.</p>
