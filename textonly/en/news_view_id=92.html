A limited number of “Family Packages” which will include 4 premium orchestra seats and a set of three signed books – one from each author – will also be on sale at that time for $1,000.  Anyone who purchases a ticket will have the opportunity to submit a question for the authors via email.  <br><br>This is the first reading I've done in America since 2000, so I'm looking forward to it very much and hope to see some regular jkrowling.com visitors there!<br></p>
