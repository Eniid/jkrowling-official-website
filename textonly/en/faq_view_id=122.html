<h2>Section: F.A.Q.</h2>
 

<h4>(SPOILER WARNING)</h4>
<h3>What exactly happened when Voldemort used the Avada Kedavra curse on Harry in the forest?</h3>
<p>Again, Voldemort violated deep laws of magic he did not understand, but there is more to it than that.<br><br>Having taken Harry’s blood into himself, Voldemort is keeping alive Lily’s protective power over Harry.  So Voldemort himself acts almost like a Horcrux for Harry – except that the power of Lily’s sacrifice is a positive force that not only continues to tether Harry to life, but gives Voldemort himself one last chance (Dumbledore refers to this last hope in chapter 35).  Voldemort has unwittingly put a few drops of goodness back inside himself; if he had repented, he could have been healed more deeply than anyone would have supposed.  But, of course, he refused to feel remorse.<br><br>Voldemort is also using the Elder Wand - the wand that is really Harry’s.  It does not work properly against its true owner; no curse Voldemort casts on Harry functions properly; neither the Cruciatus curse nor the Killing Curse.  The Avada Kedavra curse, however, is so powerful that it does hurt Harry, and also succeeds in killing the part of him that is not truly him, in other words, the fragment of Voldemort’s own soul still clinging to his.  The curse also disables Harry severely enough that he could have succumbed to death if he had chosen that path (again, Dumbledore says he has a choice whether or not to wake up).  But Harry does decide to struggle back to consciousness, capitalises on Lily’s ‘escape route’, and pulls himself back to the realm of the living.<br><br>It is important to state that I always saw these kinds of magic (the very deepest life and death issues) as essentially un-scientific; in other words, there is no “Elder Wand + Lily’s Blood = Assured Survival” formula.  What count, ultimately, are Harry and Voldemort’s own choices.  They have each been given certain weapons and safeguards, but the power of these objects and past happenings lie in how they are understood, and how they are used or enacted upon.  Harry has a deeper and truer understanding of the meaning of the objects and past events, but his greatest powers, those that save him, are free will, courage and moral certainty.</p>
