<h3>Spell Definitions</h3>
<p>Every now and then somebody asks me for the difference between a spell, a charm and a hex.  Within the Potter world, the boundaries are flexible, and I imagine that wizards may have their own ideas.  Hermione-ish, however, I've always had a working theory:<br><br>Spell:<br>The generic term for a piece of magic.<br><br>Charm:<br>Does not fundamentally alter the properties of the subject of the spell, but adds, or changes, properties.  Turning a teacup into a rat would be a spell, whereas making a teacup dance would be a charm.  The grey area comes with things like 'Stunning Spells', which on balance I think are Charms, but which I call spells for alliterative effect.<br><br>Hexes:<br>Has a connotation of dark magic, as do jinxes, but of a minor sort.  I see 'hex' as slightly worse.  I usually use 'jinx' for spells whose effects are irritating but amusing.<br><br>Curses:<br>Reserved for the worst kinds of dark magic.<br></p>
