<h3>NAQ</h3>
<p>... which means, 'never asked question'.  <br><br>Why did Dumbledore have James' invisibility cloak at the time of James' death, given that Dumbledore could make himself invisible without a cloak?<br><br>Prior to posting this I had a quick look on-line, and realised that some fans have been speculating about this question.  However, nobody has ever asked me about it, and they really should have done.  Just to allay the fears of the justifiably suspicious, this isn't what we in the know call 'a Mark Evans situation.'*  There IS a significant - even crucial - answer.<br><br>* Note to newcomers: my attempt to put to rest certain wild theories about the unimportant character of 'Mark Evans' backfired when I inadvertently built up even more excitement by promising to explain his significance.<br></p>
