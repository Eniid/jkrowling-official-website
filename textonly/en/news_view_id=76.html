<h3>London Premiere of Prisoner of Azkaban</h3>
<p>I first saw 'Prisoner of Azkaban' a few weeks ago when it was barely finished.  I loved it immediately: it is my favourite Harry Potter film so far, so I was looking forward to seeing it again on Sunday.<br><br>The premiere was fun, as always.  It was the first time I had met Gary Oldman, David Thewlis and Michael Gambon, all of whom do a really magnificent job in the film.  And it was, as ever, great to see Dan, Rupert and Emma, who get taller and better looking (and in Emma's case, more beautiful) every time I see them, and are still, miraculously, the most grounded, least egotistical teenage actors you are ever likely to meet.  The last time I saw Dan at the after-premiere party he was encircled by a group of determined female fans who were not keen on letting anyone else near him, and that included passing writers, but we managed to shout a few words at each other...<br><br>Somebody from Warner Bros. offered me one of the giant, blow-up Aunt Marges that they had tied around the front of the cinema, but I thought it would have been more fun to untie them and let them drift over the country for the next couple of days.  Pink Floyd did it with that giant inflatable pig... but most of the people reading this will be too young to know what on earth I'm talking about.</p>
