<h2>Section: F.A.Q.</h2>
 


<h3>Will you sign my book?</h3>
<p>Every one of my sixty-something publishers, my agent, my friends, my relatives and my neighbours are constantly approached by people who want me to sign their books.  The sad truth is I couldn't sign all of these books even if I gave up writing, eating or sleeping.  These days the only books I sign are for charities or in very special circumstances.  I am truly sorry about this, but I think you would all rather I wrote books six and seven than spent my life signing books one to five.  So please, please, please do not send me your books for signature.  I no longer get to see the books that are being sent, which are returned to the sender.</p>
