<h3>As Publication Draws Nearer...</h3>
<p>Well, here we go again!  The gossip, the non-stories, the ever-wilder speculation...<br><br>Please remember that allegations of 'leaks' concerning deaths in 'Half-Blood Prince' are very easy to make.  Any comment I make on such rumours would be a spoiler, so I'll just repeat: keep those barrels of salt handy.  Speaking of which...<br><br>I have been alerted to the fact that I am supposed to have posted in the 'comments' section of a couple of different fan sites recently.  I never post on fan sites and it is important that you all know this, because the last thing I would want is for any of you to be misled or otherwise manipulated by somebody posing as me online.  JKRowling.com is the only place I ever post.  Lest you think I'm protesting too much, please ask yourself whether I would really want to reveal my email address on a fan site.  Love you all though I do, I don't really want to wake up tomorrow and have to download 21,956,038 new emails, all demanding the identity of the Half-Blood Prince.<br></p>
