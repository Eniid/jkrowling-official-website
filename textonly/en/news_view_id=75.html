<h3>Reaction to JKRowling.com</h3>
<p>Watching Harry Potter fans spread the news about this site, work out all the riddles in about ten minutes, collect all the prizes, then proceed to hack the site apart looking for more clues... well, I must say I never dreamed that sitting in front of a computer could be so much fun.  I can see that this site is going to be a great source of entertainment and amusement to me.<br><br>I would like to make two points: firstly, as I said in a recent interview, if there is ever a time when I am not doing updates, it is because I am writing hard.  Either way, you win!  Secondly, since the updated website went live, many people have been enthusiastically emailing Christopher Little, my agent, Colman Getty, my PR firm, and even Lightmaker, who run the site.  None of these people can answer such emails, nor will they be passed to me.  As I say in my 'welcome' note, this website has been created precisely because I cannot answer fans individually any more.<br><br>You will find my response to some of the rumours about the site in (where else?) Rumours.</p>
