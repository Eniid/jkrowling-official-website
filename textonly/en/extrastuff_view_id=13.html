<h3>Minesweeper</h3>
<p>In the bad old days, when I wanted a few minutes' break while writing, I used to light up a cigarette.  I gave up smoking in the year 2000 and now chew a lot of gum instead (hence the state of my desk).  However, chewing a bit of gum does not give you an excuse for a nice little brain-resting break, so instead I like to escape the complexities of the latest plot by playing a quick game of Minesweeper.  Since giving up smoking I must boastfully inform you that I have become rather good and that my current best time for expert level is 101 seconds.</p>
