<h4>(SPOILER WARNING)</h4>
<h3>Immeritus</h3>
<p>I love this site, which I discovered towards the end of writing Order of the Phoenix, and which made me feel exceptionally guilty, as you can imagine.  I am so proud of the fact that a character, whom I always liked very much, though he never appeared as much more than a brooding presence in the books, has gained a passionate fan-club.<br><br>At the launch of Goblet of Fire at King's Cross, London, I shook hands with a woman who leaned forward and whispered conspiratorially, 'Sirius Black is sexy, right?'  And yes, of course she was right, as the Immeritus club know.  The best-looking, most rebellious, most dangerous of the four marauders... and to answer one burning question on the discussion boards, his eyes are grey.<br><br>The fan art on here is very good.  For a while I had a picture of the four marauders drawn by Laura Freeman on my desktop.  It is a particularly accurate portrayal of Sirius and Lupin.</p>
