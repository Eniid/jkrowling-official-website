<h3>Meeting Melissa and Emerson</h3>
<p>The plans for publication of Half-Blood Prince were underway and I was trying to think of a way to solve a recurring problem: the frustration often felt by dedicated (older) Potter fans at the fact that I am rarely posed the questions they most want asked.  The solution, I decided, would be a face-to-face interview with one or two true emissaries of the diehard fans, capable of hitting me with the tough, book-seven-exploring, backstory-probing, inconsistency-highlighting, character-analysing questions that I hardly ever get round to answering, and certainly not at book launch time.  My feeling was that even if I said I couldn't answer – because I didn't want to ruin theories or give too much away (or because I didn't know the answer!) - you would at least have the satisfaction of knowing that I had been put on the spot by people who knew where the spot was.  So how was I going to find the inquisitors?<br><br>Well, I could pretend it was difficult, but I wouldn't be fooling anyone; the answer was right under my nose; in fact, if it had been any closer I would have snorted it up as surely as I snorted a well-known fizzy drink during the resultant interview.  Yes, step forwards Melissa Anelli, founder of The Leaky Cauldron fansite, and Emerson Spartz, founder of Mugglenet.  (Links to both can be found in the 'fansite' section of this website).  <br><br>Why Melissa and Emerson?  Because I knew, from having trawled their sites, that they know their Harry Potter back to front, that they care, not only about the books, but about the community of fans on the net, and that they were clever and funny and that I was going to enjoy meeting them at least as much as they would enjoy meeting me.<br><br>So I called them.  Melissa had been tipped off to expect a call, but the ear-piercing shriek that met my words of introduction told me that she hadn't guessed what it was all about.  She was available and happy to come – one down.<br><br>I was worried that Emerson, who was not expecting anything at all, might simply hang up on me; as I heard his Dad walking away from the telephone to fetch him I was trying to think of way to prove it was really me and not some angry Harry/Hermione shipper trying to lure him down a dark alleyway.  However, I didn't need to offer an impromptu quiz on the sub-plots of books one to five; he believed me, he could make it: we were set!<br><br>I must say that I was impressed and moved by how many fellow fans posted congratulations to them when they announced on their sites that they would be interviewing me.  The thrust of most comments was that they deserved the interview as a reward for all their hard work; it was uplifting to see so many people express generous and fair-minded good wishes!<br><br>I knew they were somewhere around on launch night, but didn't see them.  Not until Saturday afternoon did I finally come face-to-face with them, in the office beside my house where my long-suffering PA deals with mountains of post.  I was so excited as I went through the door… for one thing, I had not yet spoken to a single fan who had finished the book…<br><br>And there they were, waiting for me.  I had met Melissa twice before, though each time for no longer than it took to squeak excitedly at each other; she is (for those of you who don't know) a good-looking redhead who shares my taste in both coffee and shoes (she presented me with some truly ambrosial coffee, available only in the States, and I openly coveted her faux-snakeskin heels).  Emerson is about seven feet tall (or that's how he looked from my 5' 5&quot;) and has extraordinarily long, very blue eyes; he, too, had brought presents, including a key representing the freedom of LaPorte, Indiana, accompanied by a proclamation signed by the Mayor.  No, not kidding.  'Well, it's hard trying to think of stuff you can't buy for yourself,' he said as I gazed at these items, dumbstruck.<br><br>We laughed at the strangeness of the situation – it was a little like a three-cornered blind date – and then settled down to talk properly.  They were both, as I had known they would be, wonderful.  Funny, bright, completely committed to getting some proper answers out of me.  We were supposed to be together an hour: two had passed before any of us noticed and if I hadn't had a baby to feed, I think we could have gone on most of the night.<br><br>The transcript of the interview, plus their own individual reports on their time in Edinburgh, can be read on the-leaky-cauldron.org and on mugglenet.com.  I will only say that I hope you enjoy reading the interview as much as I enjoyed giving it.  In the meantime, I am making enquiries as to what I am allowed to do in LaPorte now that I have the key.<br><br></p>
