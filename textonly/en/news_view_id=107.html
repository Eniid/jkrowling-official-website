<h3>The Children's High Level Group to publish &quot;The Tales of Beedle the Bard&quot; on 4th December 2008</h3>
<p>There was understandable disappointment among Harry Potter fans when only one copy of &quot;The Tales of Beedle the Bard&quot; was offered to the public last December.  I am therefore delighted to announce that, thanks to the generous support of Bloomsbury, Scholastic and Amazon (who bought the handwritten copy at auction) - and with the blessing of the wonderful people who own the other six original books  - &quot;The Tales of Beedle the Bard&quot; will now be widely available to all Harry Potter fans.  Royalties will be donated to the Children's High Level Group, to benefit institutionalised children in desperate need of a voice.  The new edition will include the Tales themselves, translated from the original runes by Hermione Granger, and with illustrations by me, but also notes by Professor Albus Dumbledore, which appear by generous permission of the Hogwarts Headmasters' Archive.'   'Dumbledore's commentary on the Tales, which was discovered among his papers after his death, includes some historical notes, personal reminiscences, and insights into that most mysterious branch of magic:  wandlore.   I very much hope that readers coming to these classic wizarding fables for the first time will find his commentary both entertaining and helpful.</p>
