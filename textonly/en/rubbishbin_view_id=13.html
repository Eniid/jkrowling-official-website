<h2>Section: Rubbish Bin</h2>

<p>Symbol(s): Pure Garbage</p>
<h3>According to a British newspaper, I recently appeared at a Brazilian literary festival.  And was I content to take home a nice bit of pottery or leatherwork as a souvenir?</h3>
<p>No, not good enough for JK.  I decided to buy myself a palatial Brazilian holiday home while I was there.<br><br>If any Brazilian Harry Potter fans are reading this and wondering why they never got the chance to buy tickets to hear me read, it's because I've never been to Brazil.  And if any Brazilian property dealers are wondering why they didn't get my business, it's because I've never bought a house in Brazil, either.  Not even the sumptuous colonial-style mansion, whose grounds nudge the edge of a forest, described in the article.  <br><br>My imaginary neighbour was Mick Jagger, too.  I'd say you couldn't make it up... except someone has.</p>
