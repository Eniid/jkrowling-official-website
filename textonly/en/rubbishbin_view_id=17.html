<h3>J K Rowling demands 2 million rupees from religious charities in India</h3>
<p>Recently there were a number of reports that Warner Bros. and I had taken legal action against religious charities in India because they constructed a Hogwarts castle as part of a Hindu festival.  Here are the facts.<br><br>The defendants were not religious charities, and theirs was not a religious celebration.  On the contrary, it was a large-scale, commercial, sponsored event involving corporations that included a major Indian high street bank.  The event was, however, set up while a Hindu festival was going on.<br><br>It was Warner Bros who brought the case, because the rights that were being infringed belong to them, not me.  My name has to be attached to such proceedings as a legal technicality, because I am the underlying creator of Harry Potter series.<br><br>Also due to a technicality, Warner Bros were obliged to claim damages as part of their claim.  However, they waived this right, and neither sought nor obtained any financial compensation.  It is completely false to assert that they, or I, were trying to take money from anybody, let alone two million rupees.<br><br>The court ruled that Warner Bros. rights had indeed been infringed, and that events such as the one in question would need Warner Bros.' permission in the future.  The court also restrained all the defendants from any future events infringing Warner Bros. rights.  <br><br>Some of the news agencies and newspapers who misreported this story subsequently issued corrections and apologies, but the original, false story is still doing the rounds.  In the immortal words of Mark Twain, 'a lie can get halfway around the world before the truth can even get its boots on.'  <br></p>
