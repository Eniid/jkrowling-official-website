# Directions for setting up the site with EasyPHP

In case you don't have a PHP server to host these files on, here's some directions how to set a virtual one up locally via a program called EasyPHP. This will let you run the site completely offline on your own computer. (Note: These instructions are for Windows)

1. Download and install EasyPHP **Dev**server from http://www.easyphp.org/
2. Edit your firewall settings to let EasyPHP through.
3. Download and unzip one of the [releases](https://github.com/jkrowling-official-website/jkrowling-official-website#installation)
4. Run EasyPHP. It should create an icon in the taskbar.
5. Click the icon and then click Open Dashboard
6. The dashboard should open in your browser. (If it doesn't open see step #2)
7. Under "WORKING DIRECTORIES", click +add directory and give it a name and the filepath where you extracted the zip files.
8. Under "HTTP SERVER", click > start.
9. Under "WORKING DIRECTORIES", click the bolded name you made in step #6. (It should have an "Open in Browser" mouseover.)
10. It should open the site in a new tab. (Make sure that flash is enabled.)
