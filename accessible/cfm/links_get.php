As a direct result of that piece, I became one of the founding directors of a charity called the Children's High Level Group, which campaigns for the protection and promotion of children's rights.If you are interested in finding out more about the use of cage beds, and why so many human rights and mental health organizations believe they should be outlawed for good, the links below will give you more information. As you will see, the first link takes you to the website of the Mental Disability Advocacy Centre (MDAC). It gives details of the people to write to if you would like to join the campaign. News on the use of cage beds and the campaign to ban them:www.mdac.info/cagebeds.htmAn in-depth report on cage beds and the institutions where they are used [BE WARNED - VERY DISTURBING]http://www.mdac.info/documents/Cage_Beds.pdfThe UN Convention on the Rights of the Child:www.unhchr.ch/html/menu3/b/k2crc.htmArticle on Dr. Jan Pfeiffer, Czech campaigner against cage beds:www.time.com/time/europe/magazine/printout/0,13155,901041011-703543,00.htmlOriginal article that led to my membership of the Children's High Level Group:[BE WARNED - VERY DISTURBING]http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,8122-1145143,00.htmlThe Children's High Level Group - The Children's VoiceThe Children’s Voice campaign wants to make life better for young people in care; across Eastern Europe and ultimately across the whole of the modern world.The campaign is run by The Children’s High Level Group (CHLG), and aims to stamp out cruelty, neglect and abuse of young people.http://www.chlg.org]]></c></r></rs></x><?php } ?><?php if($ref == "cl" ){?><x><rs n="links" c="t,c"><r><c n="t"><![CDATA[Christopher Little]]></c><c n="c"><![CDATA[The Christopher Little Literary Agency represents J K Rowling on a worldwide basis and with respect to all media - publishing, audio, film, TV and allied rights.

Many of these children are forced to live in cramped, unhygienic and basic accommodation. Violence and bullying is a common occurrence and there are many cases of children being chained and caged. These are the sort of practices that we want to bring to an end, so that no child in the 21st century ever has to endure such appalling conditions again.The CHLG also highlights the positive changes in child welfare that are beginning to take root in these countries, and are helping transform the lives of hundreds of thousands of children. CHLG's hope is that this will create a momentum for change across the whole of Europe.The Children’s High Level Group (CHLG) is a charity whose mission is to improve the well-being, health and protection of vulnerable children and was founded by, amongst others, MEP Emma Nicholson and myself in 2005, when we were very deeply moved by the poverty, sickness and maltreatment of children and decided to act.]]></c></r></rs></x><?php } ?><?php if($ref == "mm" ){?><x><rs n="links" c="t,c"><r><c n="t"><![CDATA[Missing Madeleine]]></c><c n="c"><![CDATA[Jerry and Kate McCann released this last photograph of their daughter before her abduction in the Algarve eight weeks ago. The picture is of Madeleine sitting by the swimming pool on the day she was snatched from her bed. Kate took the photo of Madeleine at 2.29pm on May 3 - Mrs McCann's camera clock is one hour out so the display reads 1.29pm. Less than eight hours later, before 10pm that night, Madeleine disappeared. Mr and Mrs McCann, backed by an army of friends and family, remain convinced that four year old Madeleine is alive and are praying, along with people around the world, for her safe return.How you can helpIf you have any information you can call:Portuguese Police direct on 00351 282 405 400Or British Police on 0800 096 1233You can also give information anonymously to Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.

She chose the Society because her late mother was diagnosed with MS when JK Rowling was just 15.Multiple Sclerosis (MS) affects young adults (3 women for every 1 man diagnosed) and more people have MS in Scotland than anywhere else in the world - around 1 in 500 people, so you are likely to know someone who is affected.MS is the result of damage to  the 'myelin', the protective coating on our nerves (this damage leaves a scar - the word 'multiple' means 'lots' and 'sclerosis' means 'scars'). If you imagine that when you want to do anything - eg, move your hand to pick up a pencil - your brain has to send a message down through your central nervous system to your hand to tell it to do this.  If it is damaged then the message that your brain sends can't travel smoothly - it's like an interrupted bumpy path.  So, something simple like picking up a pencil can become a hugely difficult and frustrating action because your brain can't get the message to your hand properly.With MS, everyday activities become far more difficult and those with MS really need the support of their families and friends (for example if your friend's mum or dad has MS, they may not have much time to play as they will be helping with housework or shopping).  The MS Society exists to help everyone in Scotland affected by MS and their families to live as full a life as possible.Although its cause is not yet known, JK Rowling is helping to fund our world leading research projects right here in Scotland and we are confident they will one day lead us to a cure.For more information about our work, visit www.mssocietyscotland.org.ukFor help or advice, call our Free MS Helpline: 0808 800 8000]]></c></r></rs></x><?php } ?><?php if($ref == "parent" ){?><x><rs n="links" c="t,c"><r><c n="t"><![CDATA[One Parent Families]]></c><c n="c"><![CDATA[One Parent Families is a charity working with lone parents and their children.
