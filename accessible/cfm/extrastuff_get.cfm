The trouble with that chapter was (as so often in a Harry Potter book) I had to give a lot of information yet conceal even more.  There were various versions of scenes in which you actually saw Voldemort entering Godric's Hollow and killing the Potters and in early drafts of these, a Muggle betrayed their whereabouts.  As the story evolved, however, and Pettigrew became the traitor, this horrible Muggle vanished.Other drafts included a character by the name of 'Pyrites', whose name means 'fool's gold'.  He was a servant of Voldemort's and was meeting Sirius in front of the Potters' house.  Pyrites, too, had to be discarded, though I quite liked him as a character; he was a dandy and wore white silk gloves, which I thought I might stain artistically with blood from time to time.	The very, very earliest drafts of the first chapter of 'Philosopher's Stone' have the Potters living on a remote island, Hermione's family living on the mainland, her father spotting something that resembles an explosion out at sea and sailing out in a storm to find their bodies in the ruins of their house.  I can't remember now why I thought this was a good idea, but I clearly recognised that it wasn't fairly early on, because the Potters were re-located to Godric's Hollow for all subsequent drafts.]]></c></r>

When I was working in London in the late 1980s I used to eat my lunch in a nearby square on sunny days and a large, fluffy ginger cat that looked as though it had run face-first into a wall used to prowl around the sunbathers there; I assume it lived in a nearby house.  I didn't ever get close enough to give myself an asthma attack, but I became distantly fond of this cat, which prowled among the humans around it looking disdainful and refusing to be stroked.  When I decided to give Hermione an unusually intelligent cat I gave him the appearance of this haughty animal, with the slightly unfair addition of bandy legs.Crookshanks, as anybody who has read Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them will have guessed, is half Kneazle.  And if you don't know what a Kneazle is, you need to hurry up and buy Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them (all royalties go to help some of the poorest children in the world).]]></c></r>
<r><c n="ID"><![CDATA[11]]></c><c n="c"><![CDATA[In the first draft of 'Chamber of Secrets', Nick sang a self-penned ballad explaining how his head had (nearly) come off.  My editor was not very fond of the song and so I cut it.  However, for those who are curious, here is the story of Nick's decapitation in his own moving words.It was a mistake any wizard could makeWho was tired and caught on the hopOne piffling error, and then, to my terror,I found myself facing the chop.Alas for the eve when I met Lady GrieveA-strolling the park in the dusk!She was of the belief I could straighten her teethNext moment she'd sprouted a tusk.I cried through the night that I'd soon put her rightBut the process of justice was lax;They'd brought out the block, though they'd mislaid the rockWhere they usually sharpened the axe.Next morning at dawn, with a face most forlorn,The priest said to try not to cry,"You can come just like that, no, you won't need a hat,"And I knew that my end must be nigh.The man in the mask who would have the sad taskOf cleaving my head from my neck,Said "Nick, if you please, will you get to your knees,"And I turned to a gibbering wreck."This may sting a bit" said the cack-handed twitAs he swung the axe up in the air,But oh the blunt blade!  No difference it made,My head was still definitely there.The axeman he hacked and he whacked and he thwacked,"Won't be too long", he assured me,But quick it was not, and the bone-headed clotTook forty-five goes 'til he floored me.And so I was dead, but my faithful old headIt never saw fit to desert me,It still lingers on, that's the end of my song,And now, please applaud, or you'll hurt me.]]></c></r>

So far I have heard of a newborn baby who actually has Harry's full name (Harry James Potter), a barrister in London, a grandfather who was very pleased that he had become cool in his grandchildren's eyes, a soldier who died in the second world war (I was sent a picture of his tombstone) and a clockmaker who worked in London in the last century.]]></c></r>

I gave up smoking in the year 2000 and now chew a lot of gum instead (hence the state of my desk).  However, chewing a bit of gum does not give you an excuse for a nice little brain-resting break, so instead I like to escape the complexities of the latest plot by playing a quick game of Minesweeper.  Since giving up smoking I must boastfully inform you that I have become rather good and that my current best time for expert level is 101 seconds.]]></c></r>

In my opinion, the best writing cafe is just crowded enough so that you blend in, but not so crowded that you end up sharing a table with somebody who tries to read chapter twenty upside down, has staff who don't glower at you if you sit there too long (though these days I can afford to keep ordering coffees even if I don't drink them, so that's less of a problem) and doesn't play very loud music, which is the only noise that disturbs me when I'm writing.]]></c></r>

<r><c n="ID"><![CDATA[18]]></c><c n="c"><![CDATA[I gave Harry a wand made of holly wood back in 1990, when I first drafted chapter six of ‘Philosopher’s Stone’.   It was not an arbitrary decision: holly has certain connotations that were perfect for Harry, particularly when contrasted with the traditional associations of yew, from which Voldemort’s wand is made.  European tradition has it that the holly tree (the name comes from ‘holy’) repels evil, while yew, which can achieve astonishing longevity (there are British yew trees over two thousand years old), can symbolise both death and resurrection; the sap is also poisonous.Some time after I had given Harry his holly-and-phoenix wand I came across a description of how the Celts had assigned trees to different parts of the year and discovered that, entirely by coincidence, I had assigned Harry the ‘correct’ wood for his day of birth.  I therefore decided to give Ron and Hermione Celtic wand woods, too.  Ron, who was born in the February 18 - March 17 period, was given an ash wand (I think I had originally marked him down for beech), and Hermione, who was born between September 2 and September 29, received a vine wood wand (I can’t remember what I originally stipulated for Hermione; possibly I had not specified a wood for her at that stage).I have only used the Celtic assignations for Ron and Hermione.  Hagrid, for instance, has an oak wand though by this Celtic system he should have a wand made of elder; in Britain, the oak is ‘King of the Forest’ and symbolises strength, protection and fecundity; what other wood could ‘choose’ Hagrid?  In any case, I liked having a hidden connection between Harry, Ron and Hermione’s wands that only I knew about (until now, anyway).  For those who are interested in the trees assigned to the different parts of the Celtic year, below is the chart that I used.  I apologise to any Celtic tree experts out there for any inaccuracies I may have reproduced (I have found slight variations between sources since I first came across this information.)December 24 - January 20 = Birch (Beth)January 21 - February 17 = Rowan (Luis)February 18 - March 17 = Ash (Nion)March 18 - April 14 = Alder (Fearn)April 15 - May 12 = Willow (Saille)May 13 - June 9 = Hawthorn (Huath)June 10 - July 7 = Oak (Duir)July 8 - August 4 = Holly (Tinne)August 5 - September 1 = Hazel (Coll)September 2 - September 29 = Vine (Muin)September 30 - October 27 = Ivy (Gort)October 28 - November 24 = Reed (Ngetal)November 25 - December 23 = Elder (Ruis)]]></c></r>
<r><c n="ID"><![CDATA[19]]></c><c n="c"><![CDATA[I have been asked all sorts of questions about Squibs since I first introduced the concept in ‘Chamber of Secrets’.  A Squib is almost the opposite of a Muggle-born wizard: he or she is a non-magical person born to at least one magical parent.  Squibs are rare; magic is a dominant and resilient gene.  Squibs would not be able to attend Hogwarts as students.  They are often doomed to a rather sad kind of half-life (yes, you should be feeling sorry for Filch), as their parentage often means that they will be exposed to, if not immersed in, the wizarding community, but can never truly join it.  Sometimes they find a way to fit in; Filch has carved himself a niche at Hogwarts and Arabella Figg operates as Dumbledore’s liaison between the magical and Muggle worlds.  Neither of these characters can perform magic (Filch’s Kwikspell course never worked), but they still function within the wizarding world because they have access to certain magical objects and creatures that can help them (Arabella Figg does a roaring trade in cross-bred cats and Kneazles, and if you don‘t know what a Kneazle is yet, shame on you).  Incidentally, Arabella Figg never saw the Dementors that attacked Harry and Dudley, but she had enough magical knowledge to identify correctly the sensations they created in the alleyway.]]></c></r>
<r><c n="ID"><![CDATA[2]]></c><c n="c"><![CDATA[Anybody who has read both the American and British versions of 'Philosopher's Stone' will notice that Dean Thomas's appearance is not mentioned in the British book, whereas in the American one there is a line describing him (in the chapter 'The Sorting Hat').This was an editorial cut in the British version; my editor thought that chapter was too long and pruned everything that he thought was surplus to requirements.  When it came to the casting on the film version of 'Philosopher's Stone', however, I told the director, Chris, that Dean was a black Londoner.  In fact, I think Chris was slightly taken aback by the amount of information I had on this peripheral character.  I had a lot of background on Dean, though I had never found the right place to use it.  His story was included in an early draft of 'Chamber of Secrets' but then cut by me, because it felt like an unnecessary digression.  Now I don't think his history will ever make it into the books.Dean is from what he always thought was a pure Muggle background.  He has been raised by his mother and his stepfather; his father walked out on the family when Dean was very young.  He has a very happy home life, with a number of half-brothers and sisters.Naturally when the letter came from Hogwarts Dean's mother wondered whether his father might have been a wizard, but nobody has ever discovered the truth: that Dean's father, who had never told his wife what he was because he wanted to protect her, got himself killed by Death Eaters when he refused to join them.  The projected story had Dean discovering all this during his school career.  I suppose in some ways I sacrificed Dean's voyage of discovery for Neville's, which is more important to the central plot.]]></c></r>
<r><c n="ID"><![CDATA[20]]></c><c n="c"><![CDATA[Owls feature in many superstitions across the world.  To the Greeks, the owl was emblematic of Athena, goddess of wisdom and war, and if an owl was sighted flying over the Greek army prior to battle it was considered an omen of victory.  To the Romans, on the other hand, the owl was an unlucky creature that predicted death and disaster.  In Britain there is a superstition that it is unlucky to see an owl by daylight, a superstition I had fun with in the first chapter of ‘Philosopher’s Stone’ where, of course, the sudden explosion of owls flying by daylight represented something very lucky indeed, though the Muggles did not know it.My wizards' owls reflect their personality to a certain extent.  Poor Ron gets Pigwidgeon, who is a Scops (these are very small owls with ears – cute, but distinctly unshowy).  Poor exhausted Errol is a Great Gray, which in my opinion is the most comical-looking owl in the world – just Google the Great Gray to see what I mean.  Naturally I gave my hero what I consider to be the most beautiful owl of the lot: the Snowy Owl, which also goes by the name of Ghost Owl.  These are not native to Britain, so I felt that she would give Harry kudos at Hogwarts (there is no other snowy owl there, as I trust you have noticed).  However, any owl expert would tell you that Hedwig is strangely atypical of her breed.  Only after Philosopher’s Stone had been accepted for publication did I realise that Snowy Owls are diurnal.  I think it was during the writing of ‘Chamber of Secrets’ that I discovered that Snowy Owls are also virtually silent, the females being even quieter than the males.  So all of Hedwig's night-time jaunts and her many reproving hoots may be taken as signs of her great magical ability or my pitiful lack of research, whichever you prefer.(Incidentally: there has been a spate of stories in the press recently concerning the upswing in popularity of keeping owls as pets, allegedly as a result of the Harry Potter books.  If it is true that anybody has been influenced by my books to think that an owl would be happiest shut in a small cage and kept in a house, I would like to take this opportunity to say as forcefully as I can: please don’t.)]]></c></r>
<r><c n="ID"><![CDATA[21]]></c><c n="c"><![CDATA[The plans for publication of Half-Blood Prince were underway and I was trying to think of a way to solve a recurring problem: the frustration often felt by dedicated (older) Potter fans at the fact that I am rarely posed the questions they most want asked.  The solution, I decided, would be a face-to-face interview with one or two true emissaries of the diehard fans, capable of hitting me with the tough, book-seven-exploring, backstory-probing, inconsistency-highlighting, character-analysing questions that I hardly ever get round to answering, and certainly not at book launch time.  My feeling was that even if I said I couldn't answer – because I didn't want to ruin theories or give too much away (or because I didn't know the answer!) - you would at least have the satisfaction of knowing that I had been put on the spot by people who knew where the spot was.  So how was I going to find the inquisitors?Well, I could pretend it was difficult, but I wouldn't be fooling anyone; the answer was right under my nose; in fact, if it had been any closer I would have snorted it up as surely as I snorted a well-known fizzy drink during the resultant interview.  Yes, step forwards Melissa Anelli, founder of The Leaky Cauldron fansite, and Emerson Spartz, founder of Mugglenet.  (Links to both can be found in the 'fansite' section of this website).  Why Melissa and Emerson?  Because I knew, from having trawled their sites, that they know their Harry Potter back to front, that they care, not only about the books, but about the community of fans on the net, and that they were clever and funny and that I was going to enjoy meeting them at least as much as they would enjoy meeting me.So I called them.  Melissa had been tipped off to expect a call, but the ear-piercing shriek that met my words of introduction told me that she hadn't guessed what it was all about.  She was available and happy to come – one down.I was worried that Emerson, who was not expecting anything at all, might simply hang up on me; as I heard his Dad walking away from the telephone to fetch him I was trying to think of way to prove it was really me and not some angry Harry/Hermione shipper trying to lure him down a dark alleyway.  However, I didn't need to offer an impromptu quiz on the sub-plots of books one to five; he believed me, he could make it: we were set!I must say that I was impressed and moved by how many fellow fans posted congratulations to them when they announced on their sites that they would be interviewing me.  The thrust of most comments was that they deserved the interview as a reward for all their hard work; it was uplifting to see so many people express generous and fair-minded good wishes!I knew they were somewhere around on launch night, but didn't see them.  Not until Saturday afternoon did I finally come face-to-face with them, in the office beside my house where my long-suffering PA deals with mountains of post.  I was so excited as I went through the door… for one thing, I had not yet spoken to a single fan who had finished the book…And there they were, waiting for me.  I had met Melissa twice before, though each time for no longer than it took to squeak excitedly at each other; she is (for those of you who don't know) a good-looking redhead who shares my taste in both coffee and shoes (she presented me with some truly ambrosial coffee, available only in the States, and I openly coveted her faux-snakeskin heels).  Emerson is about seven feet tall (or that's how he looked from my 5' 5") and has extraordinarily long, very blue eyes; he, too, had brought presents, including a key representing the freedom of LaPorte, Indiana, accompanied by a proclamation signed by the Mayor.  No, not kidding.  'Well, it's hard trying to think of stuff you can't buy for yourself,' he said as I gazed at these items, dumbstruck.We laughed at the strangeness of the situation – it was a little like a three-cornered blind date – and then settled down to talk properly.  They were both, as I had known they would be, wonderful.  Funny, bright, completely committed to getting some proper answers out of me.  We were supposed to be together an hour: two had passed before any of us noticed and if I hadn't had a baby to feed, I think we could have gone on most of the night.The transcript of the interview, plus their own individual reports on their time in Edinburgh, can be read on the-leaky-cauldron.org and on mugglenet.com.  I will only say that I hope you enjoy reading the interview as much as I enjoyed giving it.  In the meantime, I am making enquiries as to what I am allowed to do in LaPorte now that I have the key.]]></c></r>
<r><c n="ID"><![CDATA[22]]></c><c n="c"><![CDATA[Being thin.  Probably not a subject that you ever expected to read about on this website, but my recent trip to London got me thinking...It started in the car on the way to Leavesden film studios.  I whiled away part of the journey reading a magazine that featured several glossy photographs of a very young woman who is either seriously ill or suffering from an eating disorder (which is, of course, the same thing); anyway, there is no other explanation for the shape of her body.  She can talk about eating absolutely loads, being terribly busy and having the world's fastest metabolism until her tongue drops off (hooray!  Another couple of ounces gone!), but her concave stomach, protruding ribs and stick-like arms tell a different story.  This girl needs help, but, the world being what it is, they're sticking her on magazine covers instead.  All this passed through my mind as I read the interview, then I threw the horrible thing aside.But blow me down if the subject of girls and thinness didn't crop up shortly after I got out of the car.  I was talking to one of the actors and, somehow or other, we got onto the subject of a girl he knows (not any of the Potter actresses – somebody from his life beyond the films) who had been dubbed 'fat' by certain charming classmates.  (Could they possibly be jealous that she knows the boy in question?  Surely not!)'But,' said the actor, in honest perplexity, 'she is really not fat.''"Fat" is usually the first insult a girl throws at another girl when she wants to hurt her,' I said; I could remember it happening when I was at school, and witnessing it among the teenagers I used to teach.  Nevertheless, I could see that to him, a well-adjusted male, it was utterly bizarre behaviour, like yelling 'thicko!' at Stephen Hawking.  His bemusement at this everyday feature of female existence reminded me how strange and sick the 'fat' insult is.  I mean, is 'fat' really the worst thing a human being can be?  Is 'fat' worse than 'vindictive', 'jealous', 'shallow', 'vain', 'boring' or 'cruel'?  Not to me; but then, you might retort, what do I know about the pressure to be skinny?  I'm not in the business of being judged on my looks, what with being a writer and earning my living by using my brain...I went to the British Book Awards that evening.  After the award ceremony I bumped into a woman I hadn't seen for nearly three years.  The first thing she said to me? 'You've lost a lot of weight since the last time I saw you!''Well,' I said, slightly nonplussed, 'the last time you saw me I'd just had a baby.'What I felt like saying was, 'I've produced my third child and my sixth novel since I last saw you.  Aren't either of those things more important, more interesting, than my size?'  But no – my waist looked smaller!  Forget the kid and the book: finally, something to celebrate!So the issue of size and women was (ha, ha) weighing on my mind as I flew home to Edinburgh the next day.  Once up in the air, I opened a newspaper and my eyes fell, immediately, on an article about the pop star Pink.  Her latest single, 'Stupid Girls', is the antidote-anthem for everything I had been thinking about women and thinness.  'Stupid Girls' satirises the talking toothpicks held up to girls as role models: those celebrities whose greatest achievement is un-chipped nail polish, whose only aspiration seems to be getting photographed in a different outfit nine times a day, whose only function in the world appears to be supporting the trade in overpriced handbags and rat-sized dogs.  Maybe all this seems funny, or trivial, but it's really not.  It's about what girls want to be, what they're told they should be, and how they feel about who they are.  I've got two daughters who will have to make their way in this skinny-obsessed world, and it worries me, because I don't want them to be empty-headed, self-obsessed, emaciated clones; I'd rather they were independent, interesting, idealistic, kind, opinionated, original, funny – a thousand things, before 'thin'.  And frankly, I'd rather they didn't give a gust of stinking chihuahua flatulence whether the woman standing next to them has fleshier knees than they do.  Let my girls be Hermiones, rather than Pansy Parkinsons.  Let them never be Stupid Girls.  Rant over.]]></c></r>

However, nobody has ever asked me about it, and they really should have done.  Just to allay the fears of the justifiably suspicious, this isn't what we in the know call 'a Mark Evans situation.'*  There IS a significant - even crucial - answer.* Note to newcomers: my attempt to put to rest certain wild theories about the unimportant character of 'Mark Evans' backfired when I inadvertently built up even more excitement by promising to explain his significance.]]></c></r>
<r><c n="ID"><![CDATA[24]]></c><c n="c"><![CDATA[Every now and then somebody asks me for the difference between a spell, a charm and a hex.  Within the Potter world, the boundaries are flexible, and I imagine that wizards may have their own ideas.  Hermione-ish, however, I've always had a working theory:Spell:The generic term for a piece of magic.Charm:Does not fundamentally alter the properties of the subject of the spell, but adds, or changes, properties.  Turning a teacup into a rat would be a spell, whereas making a teacup dance would be a charm.  The grey area comes with things like 'Stunning Spells', which on balance I think are Charms, but which I call spells for alliterative effect.Hexes:Has a connotation of dark magic, as do jinxes, but of a minor sort.  I see 'hex' as slightly worse.  I usually use 'jinx' for spells whose effects are irritating but amusing.Curses:Reserved for the worst kinds of dark magic.]]></c></r>

I must admit that it did occur to me to do that very thing, but a short period of reflection convinced me that any latent wizarding genes would never survive contact with Uncle Vernon’s DNA, so I didn’t do it.However, I know that after Dudley’s brave attempt at reconciliation at the start of Deathly Hallows, the two cousins would have remained on ‘Christmas Card’ terms for the rest of their lives, and that Harry would have taken his family to visit Dudley’s when they were in the neighbourhood (occasions dreaded by James, Albus and Lily).]]></c></r>
<r><c n="ID"><![CDATA[3]]></c><c n="c"><![CDATA[I have spoken before now about the Weasley cousin who made it quite a long way into 'Goblet of Fire' before I cut her.  I really liked her as a character and did not want to sacrifice her, but she just wasn't doing the job she was supposed to do so she had to go.Mafalda was the daughter of the 'second cousin who's a stockbroker' mentioned in 'Philosopher's Stone'.  This stockbroker had been very rude to Mr. and Mrs. Weasley in the past, but now he and his (Muggle) wife had inconveniently produced a witch, they came back to the Weasleys asking for their help in introducing her to wizarding society before she starts at Hogwarts.  The Weasleys agreed to taking her for part of the Summer, including the Quidditch World Cup, but regretted this almost immediately.  Mrs. Weasley suspected that Mafalda's parents simply wanted to get rid of her for a while, because she turns out to be the most unpleasant child Mrs. Weasley has ever met.Mafalda was supposed to convey certain information about the Death Eaters to Harry, Ron and Hermione, because as a nosy, eavesdropping Slytherin who likes to impress, she does not keep her mouth shut when she overhears their sons and daughters talking.  Unfortunately, however bright I made her, there were obvious limitations to what an eleven year old closeted at school could discover, whereas Rita Skeeter, whom I subsequently built up to fulfil Mafalda's function, was much more flexible.	The best thing about Mafalda was that she was a match for Hermione.  To the latter's horror, Mafalda was highly gifted and a real show-off, so that Hermione was torn between deploring the rule-breaking and longing to join in and beat her.]]></c></r>
<r><c n="ID"><![CDATA[4]]></c><c n="c"><![CDATA[When Padfoot returns in 'Goblet of Fire', I initially had him stay with a highly- eccentric, dog-loving old witch on the edge of Hogsmeade.  She kept a pack of ill-assorted dogs, was on constant bad terms with her neighbours because of the barking and the mess, and had welcomed in Sirius, assuming him to be a stray.  I think my editor was quite right to ask me to get rid of Mopsy, because she added nothing to the plot.  I just liked portraying a batty dog-lover (as opposed to batty cat-lover Mrs. Figg).  However, it made more sense to stow Sirius in a nice simple cave to have Harry, Ron, Hermione and Sirius's chat about Barty Crouch Jnr. without distractions.]]></c></r>
<r><c n="ID"><![CDATA[5]]></c><c n="c"><![CDATA[I liked this scene so much I tried to use it twice; unfortunately, it didn't work in either place so I finally laid it to rest in one of the cardboard boxes where I keep all my old drafts, notes, electricity bills and chewing gum wrappers.As in the case of Dean Thomas, I know much more about Theodore Nott than has ever appeared in the books.  Raised by a very elderly widower and Death Eater father, Theodore is a clever loner who does not feel the need to join gangs, including Malfoy's.  However, in this scene Theodore's father (the same Nott who was badly injured in the closing chapters of 'Order of the Phoenix') goes to visit Lucius Malfoy to discuss Voldemort-related business and we see Draco and Theodore alone in the garden having a talk of their own.  I really liked the scene, firstly because it showed the Malfoys' home, and the difference between the place where Draco has grown up and number four, Privet Drive; then because we rarely see Draco talking to anybody he considers a real equal, and he is forced to see Theodore as such, because Theodore is just as pure-blooded as he is, and somewhat cleverer.  Together these two Death Eaters' sons discuss Dumbledore's regime at Hogwarts and Harry Potter, with all sorts of stories that the Death Eaters tell about how this baby boy survived the Dark Lord's attack.]]></c></r>

<r><c n="ID"><![CDATA[7]]></c><c n="c"><![CDATA[Ron was the only one of three major characters whose surname never changed; he has been 'Weasley' from start to finish.  In Britain and Ireland the weasel has a bad reputation as an unfortunate, even malevolent, animal.  However, since childhood I have had a great fondness for the family mustelidae; not so much malignant as maligned, in my opinion.There are also many superstitions associated with redheaded people and most state that they are in some way unlucky (Judas Escariot was supposedly red-haired), but this is nonsense; I happen to like red hair as well as weasels.Although I never meant him to be like Sean, once I got Ron onto the page he often behaved like my oldest friend, who is both very funny and deeply loyal.  However, there are also substantial differences between Ron and Sean.  I have only once set out to faithfully depict a real human being (see Gilderoy Lockhart); everywhere else, though I might have borrowed the occasional real person's characteristic, they are at least 90% imaginary.Before her marriage Mrs. Weasley was Molly Prewett.  As you will note from chapter one, Philosopher's Stone, she has lost close family members to Voldemort.Arthur Weasley was one of three brothers.  Ginny (full name Ginevra, not Virginia), is the first girl to be born into the Weasley clan for several generations.  Fred and George were born - when else? - on April Fool's Day.]]></c></r>
<r><c n="ID"><![CDATA[8]]></c><c n="c"><![CDATA[In the old days the question I was asked most often was, 'how do you pronounce the girl's name?'  As I expect you have noticed, I cunningly inserted the answer to this question in 'Goblet of Fire', when I had Hermione instruct Viktor Krum how to say it properly: Her - my - o - nee.  I used to hear 'Her - moyne' a lot, but my favourite mis-pronunciation ever was 'Hermy - one.'  I think I like it better than the proper way.In the dim and distant past Hermione's surname was 'Puckle', but it didn't suit her at all and was quickly changed for something a little bit less frivolous.  Hermione's birthday is September the 19th.When we were editing 'Philosopher's Stone' my editor wanted me to cut the scene in which Harry, Ron and Hermione fight the troll.  Although I had accepted most of the smaller cuts he wanted me to make I argued hard for this one.  Hermione, bless her, is so very annoying in the early part of 'Philosopher's Stone' that I really felt it needed something (literally) huge to bring her together with Harry and Ron.I have often said that Hermione is a bit like me when I was younger.  I think I was seen by other people as a right little know-it-all, but I hope that it is clear that underneath Hermione's swottiness there is a lot of insecurity and a great fear of failure (as shown by her Boggart in 'Prisoner of Azkaban').]]></c></r>
<r><c n="ID"><![CDATA[9]]></c><c n="c"><![CDATA[I have only once set out to depict somebody I have met and, unlikely though it might seem, the result was Gilderoy Lockhart.  I assure you that the person on whom Gilderoy was modelled was even more objectionable than his fictional counterpart.  He used to tell whopping great fibs about his past life, all of them designed to demonstrate what a wonderful, brave and brilliant person he was.  Perhaps he didn't really believe he was all that great and wanted to compensate, but I'm afraid I never dug that deep. You might think it was mean of me to depict him as Gilderoy, but you can rest assured he will never, ever guess.  He's probably out there now telling everybody that he inspired the character of Albus Dumbledore.  Or that he wrote the books and lets me take the credit out of kindness.]]></c></r></rs></x>
