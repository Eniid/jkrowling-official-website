<h3>Auction of 'the Tales of Beedle the Bard'</h3>
<p>As you may already know, the seventh copy of 'The Tales of Beedle the Bard' raised a staggering Â£1.95 million at auction, which will be donated to the Children's Voice campaign (see Links).<br> <br>It is fortunate that nobody was filming my reaction while the bids climbed higher and higher.  Fiddy, Angela, Christine and I were sitting around Fiddy's laptop in our office (the aforementioned being my PA and the invaluable assistants who deal with the postbag), watching a live link to Sotheby's.  Once the amount hit a million, I kept swearing loudly with every successive bid, and when we reached the final amount, the air turned a lovely shade of blue...<br> <br>I am delighted that Amazon bought the book, and would like to thank them for their huge generosity, which will help the Children's Voice reach many, many more institutionalised children.  I am also thrilled to think that the moonstone Beedle will not be mouldering alone in a vault, but will be setting off on a tour of children's libraries.  Taken all in all, I could not have wished for a better outcome!</p>
