<h3>Opening Chapters of Philosopher's Stone</h3>
<p>There were many different versions of the first chapter of 'Philosopher's Stone' and the one I finally settled on is not the most popular thing I've ever written; lots of people have told me that they found it hard work compared with the rest of the book.  The trouble with that chapter was (as so often in a Harry Potter book) I had to give a lot of information yet conceal even more.  There were various versions of scenes in which you actually saw Voldemort entering Godric's Hollow and killing the Potters and in early drafts of these, a Muggle betrayed their whereabouts.  As the story evolved, however, and Pettigrew became the traitor, this horrible Muggle vanished.<br><br>Other drafts included a character by the name of 'Pyrites', whose name means 'fool's gold'.  He was a servant of Voldemort's and was meeting Sirius in front of the Potters' house.  Pyrites, too, had to be discarded, though I quite liked him as a character; he was a dandy and wore white silk gloves, which I thought I might stain artistically with blood from time to time.<br>	<br>The very, very earliest drafts of the first chapter of 'Philosopher's Stone' have the Potters living on a remote island, Hermione's family living on the mainland, her father spotting something that resembles an explosion out at sea and sailing out in a storm to find their bodies in the ruins of their house.  I can't remember now why I thought this was a good idea, but I clearly recognised that it wasn't fairly early on, because the Potters were re-located to Godric's Hollow for all subsequent drafts.</p>
