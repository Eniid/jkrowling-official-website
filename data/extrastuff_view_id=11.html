<h3>Nearly Headless Nick</h3>
<p>In the first draft of 'Chamber of Secrets', Nick sang a self-penned ballad explaining how his head had (nearly) come off.  My editor was not very fond of the song and so I cut it.  However, for those who are curious, here is the story of Nick's decapitation in his own moving words.<br><br>It was a mistake any wizard could make<br>Who was tired and caught on the hop<br>One piffling error, and then, to my terror,<br>I found myself facing the chop.<br>Alas for the eve when I met Lady Grieve<br>A-strolling the park in the dusk!<br>She was of the belief I could straighten her teeth<br>Next moment she'd sprouted a tusk.<br>I cried through the night that I'd soon put her right<br>But the process of justice was lax;<br>They'd brought out the block, though they'd mislaid the rock<br>Where they usually sharpened the axe.<br>Next morning at dawn, with a face most forlorn,<br>The priest said to try not to cry,<br>&quot;You can come just like that, no, you won't need a hat,&quot;<br>And I knew that my end must be nigh.<br>The man in the mask who would have the sad task<br>Of cleaving my head from my neck,<br>Said &quot;Nick, if you please, will you get to your knees,&quot;<br>And I turned to a gibbering wreck.<br>&quot;This may sting a bit&quot; said the cack-handed twit<br>As he swung the axe up in the air,<br>But oh the blunt blade!  No difference it made,<br>My head was still definitely there.<br>The axeman he hacked and he whacked and he thwacked,<br>&quot;Won't be too long&quot;, he assured me,<br>But quick it was not, and the bone-headed clot<br>Took forty-five goes 'til he floored me.<br>And so I was dead, but my faithful old head<br>It never saw fit to desert me,<br>It still lingers on, that's the end of my song,<br>And now, please applaud, or you'll hurt me.<br></p>
