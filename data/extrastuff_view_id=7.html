<h3>Some Random Facts About The Weasley Family</h3>
<p>Ron was the only one of three major characters whose surname never changed; he has been 'Weasley' from start to finish.  In Britain and Ireland the weasel has a bad reputation as an unfortunate, even malevolent, animal.  However, since childhood I have had a great fondness for the family mustelidae; not so much malignant as maligned, in my opinion.<br><br>There are also many superstitions associated with redheaded people and most state that they are in some way unlucky (Judas Escariot was supposedly red-haired), but this is nonsense; I happen to like red hair as well as weasels.<br>Although I never meant him to be like Sean, once I got Ron onto the page he often behaved like my oldest friend, who is both very funny and deeply loyal.  However, there are also substantial differences between Ron and Sean.  I have only once set out to faithfully depict a real human being (see Gilderoy Lockhart); everywhere else, though I might have borrowed the occasional real person's characteristic, they are at least 90% imaginary.<br>Before her marriage Mrs. Weasley was Molly Prewett.  As you will note from chapter one, Philosopher's Stone, she has lost close family members to Voldemort.<br><br>Arthur Weasley was one of three brothers.  Ginny (full name Ginevra, not Virginia), is the first girl to be born into the Weasley clan for several generations.  <br><br>Fred and George were born - when else? - on April Fool's Day.</p>
