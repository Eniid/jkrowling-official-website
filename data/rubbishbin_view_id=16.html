<h2>Section: Rubbish Bin</h2>

<p>Symbol(s): Pure Garbage</p>
<h3>J K Rowling does pilates, yoga, jogs, has botox injections and has cut out saturated fats</h3>
<p>Apparently I've been 'Rowling back the years' (ho, ho).  Yes, the secrets behind my new (ahem) health and beauty regime have been confided to a British newspaper by a 'friend'.  <br><br>Now, most people stop having imaginary friends once they're adults, but mine sometimes drop in on journalists to give them completely unrecognisable accounts of my life.  My carbon-based friends, however, if asked whether I jog, do pilates and yoga, have a frozen forehead or refuse cake, might well suffer some kind of mirth-induced internal injury.  <br><br>It would be churlish not to thank the journalist concerned for saying that I look better now than I did in the early days of Harry Potter's success, and I am indeed grateful for the underlying compliment.  In the interests of accuracy, however, I must point out that, far from losing weight, I've gained a good bit since the 'before' photographs featured in the article.  So J K Rowling's top tip for today is: eat more.  Perhaps my next project could be a revolutionary diet book?<br></p>
