<h2>Section: Rumours</h2>



<h3>The questions and riddles we had to answer before retrieving the secret message behind the door on 20th December are clues to the plot of 'Half-Blood Prince'.</h3>
<p>I was thinking of cracker riddles when I made up these challenges (crackers are a British Christmas institution; for those who don’t know, they are wrapped and decorated cardboard tubes that typically contain a paper hat, a present – usually something small and plastic – and a joke or riddle.  Two people take an end of the cracker and pull it apart; it goes off with a loud bang, or crack, due to what a quick Google search informs me is ‘a strip of chemically impregnated paper’.  You generally pull a cracker prior to eating your Christmas dinner, so that you can wear the stupid hat for photographs).<br><br>Anyway: the riddles and jokes you find within crackers have no deeper meaning or significance and nor, I’m afraid, do mine.  You all worked out very quickly that the riddle answers made ‘Half-Blood Prince’, but the three questions relating to Harry, Ron and Hermione relate firmly to past, and not future, books – nothing to do with the publication date, not an anagram, not a clue to the plot of HBP.  I greatly enjoyed the facetious speculation about the corned beef-loving otters from Bristol, though.</p>
