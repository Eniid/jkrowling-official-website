<h3>Auction of &quot;The Tales of Beedle the Bard&quot;</h3>
<p>When it came to finding &quot;thank you&quot; presents for the people who have been most closely involved with Harry Potter over the years, nothing shop-bought seemed personal enough.  I therefore decided to hand-write a limited number of copies of &quot;The Tales of Beedle the Bard&quot;.<br><br>As this idea came to me only after I had finished writing &quot;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows&quot;, I was left with the task of writing stories for the three titles Ron mentions in that book: &quot;The Fountain of Fair Fortune&quot;, &quot;The Wizard and the Hopping Pot,&quot; and &quot;Babbitty Rabbitty and her Cackling Stump&quot; (and if anyone thinks it was easy coming up with a tale called &quot;Babbitty Rabbitty and her Cackling Stump,&quot; let me disabuse them here.)  I've added a new story (&quot;The Warlock’s Hairy Heart&quot;) and completed the collection with the only fable already told, &quot;The Tale of the Three Brothers&quot;.<br><br>There were really six people I wanted to honour – the real insiders - but it had to be seven copies, not six.  I have therefore decided to auction the seventh book for The Children’s Voice, a campaign run by the Children’s High Level Group, the charity I co-founded to campaign for the rights of institutionalised children.<br><br>Each of the seven copies of &quot;The Tales of Beedle the Bard&quot; has a different dedication; all are leather-bound and embellished with silver and different semi-precious stones. The seventh book (the Moonstone edition) will be auctioned at Sotheby's in London on December 13th 2007. The book will be on display to the public for a short period before the sale, and catalogues will be sold, all profits going to the Children's Voice.<br></p>
