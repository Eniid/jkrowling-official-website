<h3>Hermione Granger</h3>
<p>In the old days the question I was asked most often was, 'how do you pronounce the girl's name?'  As I expect you have noticed, I cunningly inserted the answer to this question in 'Goblet of Fire', when I had Hermione instruct Viktor Krum how to say it properly: Her - my - o - nee.  I used to hear 'Her - moyne' a lot, but my favourite mis-pronunciation ever was 'Hermy - one.'  I think I like it better than the proper way.<br><br>In the dim and distant past Hermione's surname was 'Puckle', but it didn't suit her at all and was quickly changed for something a little bit less frivolous.  <br><br>Hermione's birthday is September the 19th.<br><br>When we were editing 'Philosopher's Stone' my editor wanted me to cut the scene in which Harry, Ron and Hermione fight the troll.  Although I had accepted most of the smaller cuts he wanted me to make I argued hard for this one.  Hermione, bless her, is so very annoying in the early part of 'Philosopher's Stone' that I really felt it needed something (literally) huge to bring her together with Harry and Ron.<br><br>I have often said that Hermione is a bit like me when I was younger.  I think I was seen by other people as a right little know-it-all, but I hope that it is clear that underneath Hermione's swottiness there is a lot of insecurity and a great fear of failure (as shown by her Boggart in 'Prisoner of Azkaban').</p>
