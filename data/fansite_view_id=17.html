<h3>The Leaky Cauldron</h3>
<p>It is about the worst kept secret on this website that I am a huge fan of The Leaky Cauldron, which I have mentioned before now in News items.  I have met one of its founders, Melissa, on two occasions; outside the Albert Hall before I did the reading for 'Order of the Phoenix' and after the premiere for 'Prisoner of Azkaban', and in a matter of mere months I will be talking to her properly as she will be coming over to Edinburgh to interview me on publication weekend.<br><br>'Leaky', as it is affectionately known to its many fans, is a wonderfully well designed mine of accurate information on all things Harry Potter.  It also attracts a lot of knowledgeable and entertaining debate.  So to Melissa, B.K., Kristen, Sue, John, Nick and Natalie, congratulations and thank you!  And Heidi... thank you very much for the present for Mackenzie... she wears it often!<br><br></p>
