<h3>JKR APPEARING AT EDINBURGH BOOK FESTIVAL</h3>
<p>I will be reading and answering questions at the Edinburgh Book Festival on 15th August this year.  This will be my fifth appearance at the Edinburgh Festival; there have been readings for each of the first four Potter books, and this time my appearance will coincide (roughly) with the UK publication of 'Order of the Phoenix' in paperback.<br><br>I am looking forward to this event very much, because there will be a relatively small audience, which means I can see faces and take questions directly from the fans.  Of course, events such as the readings at the Toronto Skydome and the Albert Hall are incredible, but nothing can replace the pleasure of interacting with enthusiastic readers, as opposed to waving at a sea of skin coloured blobs.<br><br>As the number of tickets is restricted, they will be available by ballot rather than on a first come, first served basis.  To apply for tickets, buy the Herald newspaper on Saturday 10th July or the Sunday Herald on 11th July to get a ballot form, or visit Bloomsburyâ€™s website at www.bloomsbury.com, where you can apply online from Monday 12th July.</p>
