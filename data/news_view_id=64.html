<h3>Forged JKR Signatures</h3>
<p>If you or any of your loved ones is thinking of buying a ‘signed’ Harry Potter book, please be careful.  The number of forged signatures has increased greatly over the last few years.<br>You should be particularly suspicious of signed copies of ‘Order of the Phoenix’.  I have never done a book signing for ‘Phoenix’, so signed British copies are very rare, American copies even rarer and other foreign editions (so far) virtually non-existent.  Any copy of ‘Phoenix’ purporting to have been signed at the ‘Picadilly’ signing is highly likely to be a fake, for instance.  <br>I sign books for charity and in special circumstances but, as explained in the FAQ section, I can no longer begin to keep up with the demand for signed books.  Unfortunately there are unscrupulous people who are only too ready to step into the breach and exploit Harry Potter fans.<br></p>
