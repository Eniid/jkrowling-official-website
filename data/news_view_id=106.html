<h3>Waterstones Charity Auction</h3>
<p>A few months ago a number of authors were invited to handwrite cards for auction by Waterstones, on June 10, all proceeds to go to English PEN, the writers' association, and the Dyslexia Action.<br><br>After playing around with a number of different ideas I decided to write a short (for me!) excerpt from a prequel to the Potter series.  It is about 800 words long and the action takes place around 3 years before Harry is born.<br><br>Although I did feel a bit like a relapsing addict as I sat down to write - the words poured from my pen with frightening ease - I am NOT working on a prequel.  Indeed, I've written that clearly at the bottom of the card itself.  I just thought that this was the best way to make money for two extremely worthwhile charities.<br><br>The good news for Potter fans who will not be able to bid at the auction is that you will be able to read the short story (along with amazing contributions from Doris Lessing, Margaret Atwood, Tom Stoppard, Irvine Welsh, Sebastian Faulks, Axel Scheffler, Lauren Child, Nick Hornby, Neil Gaiman, Lisa Appignanesi, Richard Ford, and Michael Rosen) by purchasing a book of facsimiles, which will be available in August.  The proceeds from this book, too, will go to the charities.<br></p>
